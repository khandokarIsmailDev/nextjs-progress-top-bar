## How to create nprogress bar in nextjs without making layout.js client side rendering

### Create a Providers component like this in /components/RootProvider.js and wrap your application with all the components requiring 'use client', such as next-nprogress-bar or your different contexts

```js
"use client";

import { AppProgressBar as ProgressBar } from "next-nprogress-bar";

const RootProvider = ({ children }) => {
  return (
    <>
      {children}
      <ProgressBar color="#fff" />
    </>
  );
};

export default RootProvider;
```

## After that, you can use it in your layout.js like this

```js
import RootProvider from "../components/RootProvider";

export const metadata = {
  title: "Create Next App",
  description: "Generated by create next app",
};

export default function RootLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <html lang="en">
      <body>
        <RootProvider>{children}</RootProvider>
      </body>
    </html>
  );
}
```

That is it, you can now use nprogress bar in your nextjs application without making layout.js client side rendering.
